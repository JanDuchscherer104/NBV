\subsection{Training Dataset}
\label{section:data}

To enable practical indoor scene reconstruction
based on our structured language commands
(Section~\ref{subsec:ssl_commands}),
we publicly released a new dataset called \DatasetName.
It consists of a large number of training pairs
of egocentric scene walkthroughs
linked with corresponding ground truth command sequences.

Since transformers require vast amounts of data,
we generated $100k$ synthetic scenes,
which is in comparison infeasible for real-world data.
Each synthetic scene comes with a floor plan model, 
a corresponding complete 3D scene
 as well as a simulated agent trajectory and
a photo-realistic rendering of this trajectory.
Fig. \ref{fig:dataset_teaser} illustrates
the basics of \DatasetName{}.
For brevity, we refer the reader
to 
% the supplemental material 
Appendix~\ref{sec:input_data}
for further details.
