In this paper, we revisit the Next Best View problem and propose the VIN and VIN-NBV policy, a generalizable policy that can determine a set of optimal acquisitions to maximize reconstruction quality. Our policy can be easily adapted to operate with limitations on the number of acquisitions or a time limit on agent motion. By optimizing for reconstruction quality rather than traditional coverage, the VIN-NBV policy improves final reconstruction results without requiring prior scene knowledge, extra image captures, per-scene training, or complex RL policies. Evaluations on OmniObject3D \cite{wu2023omniobject3d} show VIN-NBV outperforms state-of-the-art RL coverage based methods, reducing reconstruction error by up to 40\%. The VIN-NBV policy can enable agents to efficiently acquire necessary 3D information for various applications where time is of the essence.
