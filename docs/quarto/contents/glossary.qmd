# Glossary

## Abbreviations and Terms

**ASE** - Aria Synthetic Environments
: A large-scale dataset of 100K unique procedurally-generated indoor scenes with simulated Aria glasses sensor characteristics, egocentric trajectories, and ground truth annotations.

**CPF** - Central Pupil Frame
: The coordinate frame placed at the midpoint between the eye boxes of the left and right eye of Aria glasses. Used as the reference frame for eye gaze vectors.

**GT** - Ground Truth
: Reference data or annotations that represent the true or expected values, used for training and evaluation.

**MPS** - Machine Perception Services
: A suite of derived data processing services provided by Meta for Project Aria data, including SLAM, eye gaze tracking, hand tracking, and more.

**NBV** - Next-Best-View
: The problem of autonomously selecting the optimal next camera viewpoint to maximize information gain during active 3D reconstruction.

**OOB** - Oriented Bounding Box
: A 3D bounding box that can be arbitrarily rotated in space to tightly fit objects, unlike axis-aligned bounding boxes.

**PC** - Point Cloud
: A set of 3D points representing the geometry of a scene or object, typically acquired through depth sensors or reconstruction algorithms.

**RRI** - Relative Reconstruction Improvement
: A metric quantifying how much a candidate view would improve the quality of 3D reconstruction, accounting for coverage, novelty, and information gain.

**SLAM** - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
: A technique for building a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking the position of the sensor within it.

**SSL** - Structure Scene Language / SceneScript Language
: A structured language format for representing 3D scene layouts using primitives like walls, doors, windows, and objects with geometric parameters.

**VIO** - Visual-Inertial Odometry
: A method of estimating pose and motion by combining visual features from cameras with inertial measurements from IMUs.

**VRS** - Virtual Reality Standard (file format)
: A file format developed by Meta for storing and accessing multi-modal sensor data streams efficiently, used for Project Aria recordings.

**6DoF** - Six Degrees of Freedom
: The complete specification of a rigid body's position and orientation in 3D space (3 translational + 3 rotational degrees of freedom).

## Technical Terms

**Autoregressive Model**
: A model that generates outputs sequentially, where each element depends on previously generated elements. SceneScript uses this approach to generate structured scene representations.

**Coverage Ratio**
: The percentage of a scene or object surface that has been captured by the current set of viewpoints, often used as a metric for reconstruction completeness.

**Egocentric Trajectory**
: A camera/sensor path recorded from a first-person perspective, as captured by wearable devices like Aria glasses.

**Information Gain**
: A measure of how much new or useful information would be acquired by taking a particular action, such as capturing a view from a specific pose.

**Manhattan World**
: An assumption that all surfaces in an indoor environment are aligned with three dominant orthogonal directions (typically X, Y, Z axes).

**Semantic Gain**
: The value of a viewpoint based on the semantic importance of visible objects or regions, prioritizing task-relevant entities.

**Semi-Dense Reconstruction**
: A 3D reconstruction that contains a substantial number of points but is not completely dense, typically from feature-based SLAM systems.

**State Embedding**
: A learned or engineered representation of the current system state, combining geometric, semantic, and action information for decision making.
