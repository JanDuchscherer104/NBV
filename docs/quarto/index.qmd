# Project Overview

## Motivation

Manual 3D reconstruction of large-scale environments is **time-consuming and error-prone**. Professional teams can spend days scanning building-scale scenes with drones, and even experts frequently overlook regions that require multiple rescans [@GenNBV-chen2024].

**Next-Best-View (NBV)** planning aims to automate this process by intelligently selecting camera viewpoints that maximize information gain, but existing approaches face significant limitations:

- **Classical NBV methods** rely on hand-crafted heuristics and restricted action spaces, limiting generalization
- **Learning-based NBV policies** focus on single-object reconstruction, not complex multi-room and -entity scenes
- **Coverage-based metrics** optimize geometric completeness without considering semantic importance

## Research Vision

This project explores **semantic, entity-aware NBV planning** for large-scale indoor scene reconstruction. By leveraging SceneScript's structured scene representations [@SceneScript-avetisyan2024], we aim to:

1. **Compute Relative Reconstruction Improvement (RRI) at the entity level** — per wall, door, furniture piece
2. **Enable human-in-the-loop guidance** where users can select entities requiring high-fidelity reconstruction
3. **Develop a system that bridges semantic understanding and geometric planning**

### Key Innovation

> **Entity-Aware RRI**: Move beyond holistic scene coverage to compute reconstruction improvement separately for each semantic entity, allowing task-specific and user-guided scanning priorities.

## Project Scope

### Part 1: Seminar (6 ECTS, ~180 hours)

**Goal**: Develop a system to compute entity-level RRI for candidate views on the Aria Synthetic Environments (ASE) dataset.

**Deliverables**:

- Entity-level reconstruction quality metrics
- Visibility-based RRI computation
- Correlation analysis between different RRI formulations
- Validation on ASE benchmark scenes

### Part 2: Master Thesis (30 ECTS, ~900 hours)

**Goal**: Implement and deploy a learning-based NBV prediction system with AR interface.

**Planned Extensions**:

- View synthesis via 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Learning-based RRI predictor
- AR interface for real-time view guidance
- Real-world deployment on Meta Quest 3 or iPhone LiDAR
- Multi-agent collaborative scanning

## Technical Approach

### Foundation: SceneScript as Backbone

SceneScript [@SceneScript-avetisyan2024] provides:

- **Structured scene representation** (walls, doors, windows as geometric primitives)
- **Autoregressive generation** enabling streaming updates
- **Entity-level outputs** ideal for semantic NBV planning

### RRI Computation Strategy

We explore three complementary approaches:

1. **Entity-Level Metrics**: Compare predicted vs. ground truth SceneScript layouts
2. **Visibility-Based Coverage**: Analyze novel point visibility from candidate views
3. **View Synthesis (future)**: Use 3D Gaussian Splatting to render novel views for dense RRI

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

```
User walks around → Partial PC captured → SceneScript predicts entities
         ↓
User selects "I want this table scanned well"
         ↓
System computes entity-weighted RRI → Recommends next views
         ↓
AR overlay shows optimal viewpoints → User captures → Repeat
```

## Dataset: Aria Synthetic Environments

**100,000 synthetic indoor scenes** with:

- Egocentric RGB trajectories (~2 min/scene)
- Ground truth depth and segmentation
- SceneScript layout annotations
- Semi-dense point clouds from MPS SLAM

**Key Challenge**: Each scene has only one pre-recorded trajectory, limiting our ability to query arbitrary novel views for RRI computation. We address this through view synthesis and entity-level metrics.
